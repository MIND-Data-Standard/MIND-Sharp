Quaternions encode 3D orientation as a 4D unit vector. Maintaining basic invariants avoids silent data corruption.

## Core Concepts
A rotation quaternion *q* = (w,x,y,z) ideally satisfies |q| = 1. Pre-alpha validation enforces only the **non-zero magnitude** invariant; normalization drift checks are deferred.

| Case | Magnitude | Valid? | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Identity (1,0,0,0) | 1 | ✅ | No rotation |
| Zero (0,0,0,0) | 0 | ❌ | Undefined rotation (division by zero on normalize) |
| Near Zero | ~1e-10 | ❌ | Catastrophic amplification risk |
| Slight Drift (0.99 length) | ~0.99 | ⚠️ (future) | Normalization advisable |

## Why Reject Zero / Near-Zero
- **Mathematical invalidity:** No axis/angle representation.
- **Normalization failure:** Division by ~0 → NaN / ∞.
- **Slerp instability:** Interpolation formulas assume non-degenerate inputs.
- **Matrix conversion risk:** Generates non-orthonormal or zero matrices.
- **Propagation:** One bad orientation can poison chains of transforms.

## Validation Heuristic
```csharp
const float MinMagnitudeSq = 1e-8f;
if (magSq < MinMagnitudeSq) error("quat.zero");
```
Magnitude squared avoids the `sqrt` cost; threshold chosen to balance FP noise vs instability.

## Roadmap Enhancements
| Feature | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Finite component check | Catch NaN / ∞ early | Planned |
| Normalization drift warning | Monitor accumulation | Planned |
| Auto-normalization helper | Recover near-unit quaternions | Planned |
| Configurable tolerance | Adapt strict vs relaxed modes | Planned |

## Suggested Strict Mode Policy (Future)
1. Error if any component is NaN/∞.
2. Error if magSq < 1e-8.
3. Warn if |magSq - 1| > 1e-3.
4. Auto-normalize if within 1% of unit length.

## Interop Considerations
Normalization differences between engines (Unity, OpenXR) can introduce tiny drift—prefer tolerant warnings over hard failures to avoid log noise.

## Takeaways
A simple zero-magnitude check yields high stability ROI now; later phases will layer in adaptive drift monitoring and normalization utilities without burdening hot paths prematurely.
